    "summary": "The customer calls ITC to follow up on a complaint regarding a mistaken package in a packet of biscuits he bought. The customer wants to know if he can get a replacement. The customer care agent asks for the customer's whatsapp number to send him the company's official number to restart the whatsapp and check the number. The customer is then asked if he wants a replacement. The customer explains the nature of his complaint and the agent promises to look into the matter. The agent offers the customer a goodwill gesture of a replacement pack. The customer accepts. The agent then asks for the customer's location so that an executive can come and replace the packet with a sample. The customer sends photos of the incorrect item and is told to mention the complaint number when sending the photos. The customer is then asked if he needs anything else.",

They ask for a replacement but the customer service agent avoids giving a clear answer. The user gets agitated and explains that they buy in bulk but this package was a low standard compared to the others. They also explain that the weight of the product was not right and that there is a difference of 37 grams from the correct weight.
