    "summary": "Alok Pakom from Chennai calls the ITC customer support to tell them that his wife bought Yippee noodles, which caused him nosebleeds. He explains that the problem is the masala, which is too spicy and causes a reaction in his nostrils. He suggests that the company should do something about it, like maybe adding less spice, and offers to test it for free since he is a research scientist. He is passed on to a Tamil-speaking representative, who understands his explanation better. He goes on to explain that the problem is the powder used in the noodles, which is too spicy, and that this is a widespread problem that many people experience with the product. He offers suggestions for resolving the issue, and expresses his appreciation for the customer support team. He is eventually passed to a supervisor, who also listens to his explanation and offers to pass his suggestions on to the relevant team. The caller then goes on to give an elaborate and humorous theory about the cause of his nosebleeds, which is unrelated to the product, and suggests that ITC should make a product that capitalizes on the nostril powder. He offers to test this product as well.",

He speaks Tamil and would like to speak to a Tamil agent. He has bought and eaten the Idly Noodles and has experienced nostrils, a vegetarian side effect. He suggests using the powder from the nostrils to remove the nostrils that come from the Yippee noodles. He also suggests that the reason the product is so expensive is because it is made of chickpeas, which is a costly ingredient. He offers suggestions for improvement and feedback. The call is then transferred to a BP patient who works at a research center and is knowledgeable about the product. They discuss the ingredients and suggest that the customer consider leaving feedback and comments on the product. The call ends with the customer thanking the agent and wishing them well.",

The customer is also offered a voucher worth INR 1 lakh as an incentive to provide a suggestion to the company, albeit with the caveat that the narrator's role is just to relay the suggestion to the relevant team. The call becomes tense as the customer repeatedly asks for suggestions and the narrator's inability to provide them becomes apparent. The call eventually ends with the customer asking to be connected to the ITC (perhaps a company?) and thanking them.",
