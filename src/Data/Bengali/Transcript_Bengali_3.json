The agent asks for details about the packet, such as the print batch number, manufacturing date, and MRP. The customer says that the dough in the packet has gotten hard and is pouring out, and that they have another UID number that they can check. The agent asks if the customer has another packet, and the customer says that they do not. The agent then tells the customer that they will need to replace the packet, and that the customer should call again if they have any further issues. The customer also inquires about the remaining quantity of dough from the batch, but the agent does not have the information at hand. The agent asks the customer to send photos of the packet for further assistance and to put the call on hold.",

The customer service representative tries to gather information about the issue, including the store name and address, the manufacturing date, and the UID number on the packet. The representative informs the customer that they will need to replace the packet as it is not up to standard, and that the customer should receive a new packet shortly. The representative then tries to clarify the issue with the missing batch number and MRP, and determines that there are four kilos of product left in the two packets. The customer is informed that they will need to provide photos of the back of the packet to determine the issue.  The call is then put on hold.",
