The agent informs the customer that the product is, in fact, not pure wheat flour, but rather multi-grain flour and that he will need to check with the company if they can exchange the product as there are no more pure wheat flour packages available. The agent then asks the customer to send photos of the package as well as the batch number in order to better assist him.",
