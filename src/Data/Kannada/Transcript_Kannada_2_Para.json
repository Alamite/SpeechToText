The friend offers to help him but first asks which language he would prefer. They switch to Kannada and the friend takes down the details of the call and puts him on hold while they check the details of the caller's query. After a few minutes, the friend tells Prashank that they need more information about the products he needs and they will help him if he calls the relevant department. The call is transferred to the new department where the agent, Dhanava Desai, helps Prashank with his queries.  They manage to find a brownie option for him, which the caller repeats several times to confirm, and also helps him with another frozen snack of prawns that the caller also needs.  At the end of the call, the friend thanks Prashank for calling ITC.  The call ends.  There is a lot of background noise and the tone used by the friend and agent is polite and professional throughout the call.  The entire conversation is in Kannada.",
