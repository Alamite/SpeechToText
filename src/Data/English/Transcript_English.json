The call is transferred to the concerned agent, John, who confirms Rajendra's address and explains that the problem is probably not a recurring one, as Rajendra has been a recurrent customer for 56 months. John proceeds to register the complaint and informs their team about the issue, while Rajendra confirms that the product package is no longer available since his wife used it. The call ends with a friendly exchange and a wish for a good day.",

John informs Rajin Raima that they are sorry for the problem he had with the San Biscuit package and offers to register a complaint. Rajin provides his complete address and confirms that he still has the product package, and John promises to inform their team before ending the call.",
    "speaker_b_summary": "Rajendra Simha calls the number to inform the listener that the Luce is not up to the standard that it usually is. He has bought it for a long time, but recently the quality has decreased, so he thinks it's best to inform the listener about the problem. He bought the product from a store in his apartment complex, which is located on Bangalore Road, beside the United International School with the address H 503. There is nothing wrong with the store, and they should not be blamed for the issue with the product. To emphasize his point, he sends a photo of the product and mentions that the date is still valid. He then mentions that he is not able to send a photo and that his wife cannot figure out how to use the product. He then goes on to open another packet of Luce to show that it is in fact very good.",
