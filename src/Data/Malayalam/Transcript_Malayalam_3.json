    "summary": "The customer, whose name is apparently Nanny Ringswas, calls the Malayalam language customer service line for Zinco, apparently a company that sells IT C products, one of which is potato chips. Nanny Ringswas calls regarding the grammage, or weight, of the chips sold to them; they claim that the chips are often short in weight by 4 chips' worth. The customer service representative, in halting and heavily accented English, explains that the grammage of the chips is what is actually guaranteed by the company, and asks Nanny Ringswas to check the packet for the grammage and compare it to the weight of the chips inside. If there is a discrepancy, the representative advises them to send a photo of the chips for investigation. The call is ended amicably, with the representative apologizing and committing to investigating the issue if Nanny Ringswas sends a photo of the chips in question.",
    "speaker_a_summary": "The customer calls regarding their purchased bag of potato chips, which they believe to be of less quantity than advertised. The agent asks for the specific product details and for any available photos of the packaging to allow for proper feedback to the team. The agent explains that the correct measurement for the quantity is through the Grammage, which can be compared to the back of the packet. They ask the customer to check the Grammage and ensure it matches with the female point ten specified on the back. The customer is hesitant to the solution and the agent reiterates that without photos or samples of the packet, they cannot offer further assistance. The call ends with the agent suggesting the customer follow the previous instructions and that they are willing to help once the customer provides the requested information.",
